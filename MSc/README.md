This readme will guide you on running the notebooks in the correct order. 

1 The names of the notebook are prefixed with the order in which they should be run.

2 Feel free to skip to 2.2 and 2.3 as these two notebooks test the viability of traditional audio features. The results show that these features do not bring any value to the project.

3 Also skipping 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 is recommended as these notebooks were used in screenshotting and cropping faces from videos

4 notebook 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are in the directory 'mustard++/Facial-Expression-Recognition.Pytorch-master' because the libraries required to run these notebooks are stored in that directory

5 notebook 4.1 to 5.5 notebooks are self explanatory. The un-numbered notebooks are experimental fails but is valuable enough not to delete: future researchers can see what does not work and not follow those methods and save time.
